description=Provides improved search functionality and recipe hiding with a cataclysm-style crafting menu.
I rewrote the majority of the code behind the crafting UI. It was pretty atrocious and I refused to work with it.
It's still pretty bad, but in rewriting it I came to understand, and hopefully I made it a bit better.

Originally this was about adding some fun new options, but before long it became about me rewriting the codebase conected to this to spite the terrible practices I saw.

Hopefully this mod makes your experience a bit better, too :) 

Joypad controls haven't been properly supported in the new menu. I don't use one to play zomboid and I don't know the code well enough to implement it, sorry :(

Stress tested with 3000 items and x recipes and was still able to get 60fps
